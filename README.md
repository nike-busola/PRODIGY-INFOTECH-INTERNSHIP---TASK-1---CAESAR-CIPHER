Choosing an Action: The user picks whether they want to encrypt (e) or decrypt (d) a message. If they pick something else, the code keeps asking until they choose correctly.

Getting the Message and Shift Value: The user thn types in the message they want to encrypt or decrypt. Next, they enter a number for how much to shift each letter.

Shifting the Letters: For each letter in the message, the code checks whether it’s an uppercase or lowercase letter. It calculates the new letter by moving forward or backward in the alphabet. If it’s not a letter (like a space or punctuation), it just adds it to the result as-is.

Showing the Result: Finally, it prints out the encrypted or decrypted message.
